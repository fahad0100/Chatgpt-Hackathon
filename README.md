Application Name: URCV

The URCV is an application that uses advanced artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to create professional resumes for users. By inputting their personal data and work experience, the application generates a comprehensive and tailored resume for each user. Additionally, the application provides users with a list of possible interview questions to help them prepare for the job interview process.

### Work experience

The URCV uses natural language processing to analyze this information and create bullet points for the resume that highlight the user's accomplishments and skills. The application also suggests relevant keywords and phrases to make the resume stand out to potential employers.

### Education
The user can enter their educational background, including their degree and major. The URCV uses this information to create a section for the resume that highlights the user's academic achievements.

### Skills

The application also suggests additional skills and qualifications based on the user's work experience and education.

### Questions
